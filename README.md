# Fruit & Vegetable Recognition and Calorie Estimator üçéü•¶

## Overview
This AI-powered Streamlit web app identifies fruits or vegetables from an uploaded image and fetches their calorie information using the **Nutritionix API**. It uses a **fine-tuned MobileNetV2 deep learning model** trained on 36 food classes.


## How it Works
- Upload an image (JPG/PNG) of a fruit or vegetable.
- The app uses a MobileNetV2 model to identify the item.
- Then, it fetches the estimated calories using Nutritionix API.
- Results are shown instantly on a web interface.

## üß† Dataset Description

The dataset includes images of **36 different fruits and vegetables**, organized by class folders.

### üçé Fruits:
Banana, Apple, Pear, Grapes, Orange, Kiwi, Watermelon, Pomegranate, Pineapple, Mango

### ü•¶ Vegetables:
Cucumber, Carrot, Capsicum, Onion, Potato, Lemon, Tomato, Radish, Beetroot, Cabbage, Lettuce, Spinach, Soybean, Cauliflower, Bell Pepper, Chilli Pepper, Turnip, Corn, Sweetcorn, Sweet Potato, Paprika, Jalape√±o, Ginger, Garlic, Peas, Eggplant

All images are resized to `224x224` during training.

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.10 .
2. Open terminal in the project folder.
3. Run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   After completing the installation, run 
   ```
   streamlit run Fruits_Vegetable_Classification.py
   ```
5. Use the browser link shown in the terminal (http://localhost:8501)

## Requirements
1. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create an API key in the Nutritionix API (required for calorie estimation).

3. Replace the code in `Fruits_Vegetable_Classification.py` under the function `fetch_calories(prediction)` with your `app_id` and `api_key`:
```python
app_id = "your_app_id"
api_key = "your_api_key"
```
